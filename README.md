### Project Structure
Our project is organized into several packages and subclasses, each serving a specific purpose for our deli:

```UserInterface``` Class:

The ```UserInterface``` Class contains the entry point of the application. This is the starting class that initializes the application and handles user interactions.

It works as a blueprint by implementing classes and  methods. The customer would input their order in the intelliJ terminal in order to run our code to order their meal.

Other classes included are ```Sandwiches```, ```Chip```, ```Drink```,  ```Receipt```, ```OrderManager```, ```Topping``` and ```Order```.

We have also created Enum classes which is used to add methods in order to define a set of constant values.


### UML diagram
We break it down to three parts
